### Setup
**Recommended Environment** - Highly recommend developing using vscode in conjunction with the arduino plugin. The Intellisense enhances the development quite a bit.

The plugin is pretty much pre-configured for you. The only thing I had to worry about is how to let it know where the arduino framework is. This is done by editing the *.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json*:
(This file is generated by the arduino plugin)
```json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Linux",
            "includePath": [
                "/path/to/your/arduino/framework/arduino-1.8.13/hardware/arduino/avr/**",
                "/path/to/your/arduino/framework/arduino-1.8.13/tools/**"
            ],
            "forcedInclude": [
                "/path/to/your/arduino/framework/arduino-1.8.13/hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino/Arduino.h"
            ],
            "intelliSenseMode": "gcc-x64",
            "compilerPath": "/usr/bin/clang++",
            "cStandard": "gnu11",
            "cppStandard": "c++17"
        }
    ],
    "version": 4
}
```
Set the paths under the *includePath* and *forcedInclude* to your local framework's location.
(Wasn't able to make it work using the arduino snap package)
